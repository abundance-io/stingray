Ray Tracer implemented in C and python (seperately just because) following Peter Shirley's ray tracing in one weekend [tutorial](raytraing.github.io)
(PS - it took way more than one weekend ðŸ‘€)

### Stuff I'm planning on adding 
- Positionable camera in C - version (came up with a messy implementation of the hittable object to model OO behaviour and it'll make this pretty difficult)
- Multithreaded rendering in python - Python is really slow, since each pixel rendered is mostly unaffected by other pixels this could work 
- Switch up PPM rendering for SDL - i'll probably just end up doing this in pygame or something (using sdl directly is a pain)
